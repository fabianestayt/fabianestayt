### Hello! ðŸ‘‹

My name is FabiÃ¡n Estay, I'm an Industrial Engineer from Antofagasta, Chile.
I like all kind of technologies and I love to learn everyday about all kind of videogames, computer science, software and tools that I can apply into my work.

I've got knowledge in Python, I've been using it since 2017 for operative investigation, optimization, process automatization and a LOT of data analysis and machine learning.

Recently I've been working in personal projects using Python as a software development language, using it for backend coding and complementing it with HTML, CSS and JavaScript for frontend using React.

Also, I have a Data Science & Machine Learning certification, obtained in Coding Dojo.

Thanks for reading! I hope to get my first tech job soon, so I can make a job out of my all life hobby.

You can reach me out via linkedin or email: fabianestayt@gmail.com.

Greetings.
